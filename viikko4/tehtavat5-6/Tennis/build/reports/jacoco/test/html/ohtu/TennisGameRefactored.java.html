/**
 * Game
 * A game consists of a sequence of points played with the same player serving.
 * A game is won by the first player to have won at least four points in total
 * and at least two points more than the opponent. The running score of each game
 * is described in a manner peculiar to tennis: scores from zero to three points
 * are described as &quot;love&quot;, &quot;15&quot;, &quot;30&quot;, and &quot;40&quot;, respectively.
 * If at least three points have been scored by each player, making the player's scores equal
 * at 40 apiece, the score is not called out as &quot;40â€“40&quot;, but rather as &quot;deuce&quot;.
 * If at least three points have been scored by each side and a player has one more point
 * than his opponent, the score of the game is &quot;advantage&quot; for the player in the lead.
 * During informal games, &quot;advantage&quot; can also be called &quot;ad in&quot; or &quot;van in&quot; when
 * the serving player is ahead, and &quot;ad out&quot; or &quot;van out&quot; when the receiving player is ahead;
 * alternatively, either player may simply call out &quot;my ad&quot; or &quot;your ad&quot; during informal play.
