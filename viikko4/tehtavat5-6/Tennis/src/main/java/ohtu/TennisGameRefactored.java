/**
 * Game
 * A game consists of a sequence of points played with the same player serving.
 * A game is won by the first player to have won at least four points in total
 * and at least two points more than the opponent. The running score of each game
 * is described in a manner peculiar to tennis: scores from zero to three points
 * are described as "love", "15", "30", and "40", respectively.
 * If at least three points have been scored by each player, making the player's scores equal
 * at 40 apiece, the score is not called out as "40â€“40", but rather as "deuce".
 * If at least three points have been scored by each side and a player has one more point
 * than his opponent, the score of the game is "advantage" for the player in the lead.
 * During informal games, "advantage" can also be called "ad in" or "van in" when
 * the serving player is ahead, and "ad out" or "van out" when the receiving player is ahead;
 * alternatively, either player may simply call out "my ad" or "your ad" during informal play.
